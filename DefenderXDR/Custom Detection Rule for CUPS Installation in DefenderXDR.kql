// Custom Detection Rule for CUPS Installation in DefenderXDR

// Iâ€™ve come up with an exciting idea! ðŸ˜… How about a custom detection rule in DefenderXDR that identifies CUPS installations and automatically isolates the device if it detects an inbound UDP packet on port 631? This could serve as an auto-defense mechanism. What do you thinkâ€”could it work? ðŸ¤”


// Custom DefenderXDR Rule for CUPS Installation Detection and Isolation

let EndpointwithCUPS =
DeviceTvmSoftwareInventory
| where SoftwareName has "cups"
| project DeviceName;
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName has_any(EndpointwithCUPS)
| where Protocol has "Udp" 
| where LocalPort in (631)
| where ActionType == "InboundConnectionAttempt"
or ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
